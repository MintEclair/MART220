So basically, what ended up happening was my browser ended up having 
CORS issues when trying to run the html with the raw image files and fonts.
I did end up finding a solution, which was converting the images to
base64. The images pop up just fine but...needless to say it may 
look messy depending on how the js is viewed.

I'm not sure if this was a thing only my laptop was doing and if 
the way the example produces the images would work on other computers.
Regardless I was able to at least find a decent work around...hope 
you're not mad at me.

Have a great day!

Mint.
